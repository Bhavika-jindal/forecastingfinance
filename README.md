INTRODUCTION </br>
Leveraging quantitative analysis and predictive modeling inspired by JIM SIMONS , our prototype uses Delhi's weather data to predict stock market index movements. By systematically collecting and analyzing weather patterns, we aim to identify hidden correlations and generate actionable trading signals, driving profitable and data-driven investment decisions.

In summary, our "Weather-Driven Stock Predictor" innovatively merges environmental data with financial forecasting to provide accurate and actionable market insights. By harnessing the power of AI and machine learning, we address key themes of financial inclusion, sustainability, and advanced technology in financial planning. Our model offers users the ability to predict stock market movements based on weather conditions, making investment strategies smarter and more sustainable.
